Can I Use The Free Icons In My Projects ?

Our free icons can be used in a commercial project. However you w ould have to add a link to our website and make a state where says that the icons were created by iconshock.com. In a personal project such an application or website it is fine if you need to use them. NOTE: You can Not re-sell the icons as is, and if you want to redistribute the icons in your own website, please contact us to send you a permission.
